# ðŸŽ® Awakening Aspirations: Ignite Game Jam Creation ðŸŽ®

Dive deep into the recesses of the human mind in this thrilling game created during the **Ignite Game Jam** by Somos, in collaboration with **Blizzard** and **Activision**. Crafted passionately in just 3 days, our game was inspired by the prompt: "_What Gets You Up In The Morning_".

## ðŸ§  Game Overview ðŸ§

- **Challenges**: As in life, unexpected obstacles lurk around every corner, testing your resolve and dexterity.
- **Allies**: Luckily, the mind is a resourceful place. Discover tools and aids to assist you in overcoming hurdles and propelling you closer to your goals.
